5</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many signs of the
vitality of the English Church, which every dutiful son of hers
will hail with joy, are the various organizations of the Work of
Women which have recently sprung up amongst us, the Institution
of Deaconesses, the employment of Parochial Mission Women, and
the foundation of Sisterhoods.&nbsp; It is a mistake surely to
look coldly upon such movements, because they assume (what to our
generation is) a somewhat novel form.&nbsp; There ought to be in
every living Church a plastic power, which adapts its machinery
to the wants of the age, and to the ever-varying shapes which
Society is taking; and we rejoice to find in our own Church
evidences of this power.&nbsp; Enthusiasms many and fervent are
rising up in her, and driving her members to these new agencies,
which should not be regarded with suspicion because they are new,
but rather tried fairly, and guided discreetly, and watched
vigilantly.</p>
<p>Watching and guidance they will doubtless all <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of them want;
and most of all, Communities of women banded together under a
Superior for devotion and for acts of mercy.&nbsp; The very first
step of joining such a community may easily be taken in violation
of the principle (if not of the letter) of the Fifth
Commandment.&nbsp; It may be an act of will-worship deliberately
committed by one who slights God&rsquo;s Ordinance of the Family,
and prefers ties and sympathies of her own creation to those with
which it has pleased Him in His Providence to surround her.&nbsp;
But supposing the community composed exclusively of those who
have a moral right to join it (of those who have no ties, or none
which they cannot perfectly satisfy while living in the
comparative seclusion of a Sisterhood), the perils to which their
life exposes them are not few, and all the more dangerous because
they are subtle.&nbsp; First; there is a constant tendency to
erect a false standard of spirituality in the mind, and to
imagine a higher degree of perfection to attach to the life of a
Sister than to that of an equally devoted Christian woman living
in the world.&nbsp; This tendency culminates in the Roman
phraseology &ldquo;Religious,&rdquo; as applied to the members of
Monastic Orders, a phraseology which I for one earnestly
deprecate, and greatly regret to see adopted by some of my
clerical Brethren in speaking of these Communities.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Words,&rdquo; says Bacon, &ldquo;are like the
Tartar&rsquo;s arrows; they shoot backwards;&rdquo; and if we
allow ourselves to call the members of our <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Sisterhoods
&ldquo;Religious,&rdquo; or to speak of them as being &ldquo;in
Religion,&rdquo; we shall soon come to regard their vocation as
more spiritual than that of the Christian wife and
mother,&mdash;a notion most unspiritual and unscriptural in the
mind of the writer of this Address.&nbsp; Possibly the life of a
Sister may present fewer difficulties to the attainment of a high
standard of sanctity than life (under its ordinary conditions) in
Society; but even if this be granted, which must we rate higher,
the faith and zeal which <i>evades</i> difficulties, or the faith
and zeal which <i>meets and triumphs over</i> them?&nbsp; I
believe it might be shown that many of the most eminent doctors
of the Church, previously to the Reformation, have decided that
life in the World may be altogether as spiritual, and exemplify a
standard of holiness at least as high, as life in a
Convent.&nbsp; Then, again, it must be remembered that the
relations which the members of a religious Community contract are
artificial.&nbsp; These Communities are a kind of hotbed for
rearing devotional feeling and piety of a high caste.&nbsp; It is
not at all necessary to deny that very beautiful forms of piety
are often reared there, as very beautiful flowers are under
glass.&nbsp; But we may reasonably expect the beauty of form to
be somewhat compensated by want of vigour.&nbsp; And of course
this is especially likely to be the case with Communities of
Women.&nbsp; Without denying to the piety of Women very great and
peculiar excellences, beyond <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>those which characterize the religious
feelings of men,&mdash;while fully appreciating all the sympathy
and power of heroic endurance manifested by Christian Women, and
fully recognizing the general truth, that Religion thrives far
better in the soil of a susceptible heart than in that of a
powerful understanding,&mdash;we must yet grant that the female
type of piety has a weak side,&mdash;the side, namely, of a
morbid sentimentalism.&nbsp; Now this side may be expected to
exhibit itself in high relief in our Sisterhoods, where the
sentiments of devout Women constitute the religious atmosphere of
the place.&nbsp; And as the tone of the disciple insensibly
reacts upon the tone of the teacher, and what the first is eager
to receive the second is usually prompt to supply, it is likely
enough that the spiritual pastors and guides of such communities
will (with perfectly pure intention and without dreaming of evil)
pander to a style of religion very much out of keeping (to say
the least of it) with the sobriety of Holy Scripture, and with
the staid and dignified tone of the Book of Common Prayer.&nbsp;
Those who have read the Spiritual Letters of St. Francis de
Sales, and have observed the difference of tone between the
generality of them which are addressed to women, and the few in
which his correspondents are men, will immediately recognize what
I mean.&nbsp; Souls should be dealt with on the same principles,
whatever souls they be; the same fervour, the same unction, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>should be
manifested in the guidance of either sex; but in the direction of
his female disciples, this saintly man displays now and then a
tincture of sentimentalism which can hardly be called
healthy.&nbsp; Madame de Chantal and the others craved for
something of that sort, and he, as their director, with the
utmost artlessness, supplied it.&nbsp; There may be the truest
unction in religion without unctuousness.&nbsp; Our Litany is an
instance of this.</p>
<p>The great receipt for keeping the tone of piety sound and
healthy doubtless lies in one word, <span
class="smcap">Work</span>,&mdash;work in the cause of our
suffering fellow-men.&nbsp; And it seems to me to be a proof of
the reality of the danger which I have just been pointing out,
that in some of these Communities the Sisters have begun to
affect a life of entire seclusion from works of mercy, under
pretence of a higher devotion.&nbsp; Does not this show that
there is something in the moral atmosphere of these communities,
to which the healthy, practical, sobering tendencies of work are
uncongenial?&nbsp; I have spoken strongly in the Address on the
great danger and mischief likely to accrue from making the purely
contemplative or devotional life the ideal of high sanctity; and
indeed I have desired to make the whole Address a protest against
this false theory by assuming (what I know to be the case) that
the Sisters of St. Peter&rsquo;s Home are all busied in works of
mercy, and giving them <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>plain, practical counsels, such as
would be equally applicable to all the work which has to be done
by Christians in active life.&nbsp; These counsels are so
commonplace that those who care to read them will probably ask
for the reasons which justify me in publishing them.</p>
<p>My only reason is, that the Founder of the Home pressed their
publication, under the idea that it might be of some use in
making the Institution known.&nbsp; As he is one of those
munificent Benefactors of the Church, occasionally found among
the wealthy Laity of this great City, to whom the Clergy at all
events are bound to hold out the right hand of fellowship, I did
not feel at liberty to decline his request when it was pressed
upon me.&nbsp; In the vigilant superintendence of our Diocesan
(who kindly permits me to inscribe these pages to him) we have
every guarantee that reasonable people can desire for St.
Peter&rsquo;s Home being conducted on the soundest principles,
for its members being kept in faithful allegiance to the Church
of their Baptism, warned against and secured from those dangers
to which the experience of the Church teaches that Religious
Communities are exposed, and made a great blessing to those who
are sheltered and tended in their quiet retreat, and to the poor
and sick people in their neighbourhood.</p>
<h2><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>AN
ADDRESS, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My Sisters in Christ</span>,</p>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">READ</span> in your Primary
Constitution and Statutes that &ldquo;the whole work carried on
in this place is dedicated to St. Peter, who, more than any other
Apostle, ministered to the sick.&rdquo;&nbsp; I suppose that
there is in these words a reference to that passage of the Acts
of the Apostles, in which we are told that the people of
Jerusalem &ldquo;brought forth the sick into the streets, and
laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of
Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is in every way a remarkable passage.&nbsp; Though the notice of
these cures wrought by the Apostle&rsquo;s shadow is so
incidental, it is full of instruction.&nbsp; A shadow is an
influence cast by a man&rsquo;s body, and may usefully remind us
of the influence cast <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>by his mind.&nbsp; As all bodies must
cast a shadow in the sunlight, so every rational soul must, by
the law of our nature, exert an influence in its walk through
life on every other rational soul with which it comes in
contact.&nbsp; However narrow and however humble be the circle in
which we move, our character, habits, tone, certainly tell in it;
each action, each word, nay, each gesture and glance, is an item
in the sum total of our moral weight.&mdash;Then again, as we
cast our shadow on the pavement unconsciously, without deliberate
intention, so the moral influence, of which I am speaking, is
exercised when we least think of it.&nbsp; Words thrown out when
we are off our guard, ways of acting which have become more or
less instinctive, are all full charged with this moral influence,
and have in fact a much more powerful (though a more subtle)
efficacy than the things we say and do of set purpose.&mdash;Then
again, the shadow is always a correct outline of the body of
which it is a shadow.&nbsp; And the moral influence which we
exert without being conscious of it is always exactly true to our
character, which cannot be said of our voluntary influence.&nbsp;
A man may preach, and exhort, and throw himself into Christian
enterprises, and thus gain a reputation for piety, and yet be a
self-seeker, actuated by ambition, or a desire to stand well with
others.&nbsp; Many will say to Our Lord at the last day,
&ldquo;Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? and <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>in Thy name
have cast out devils? and in Thy name done many wonderful
works?&rdquo; to whom He will have to profess, &ldquo;I never
knew you.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this case the deliberate and voluntary
influence exerted by the man misrepresents him; we gather one
impression from his efforts, and another from his real
character.&nbsp; But the influence which he exerts unconsciously
never deceives us.&nbsp; Live side by side with him for a month;
watch him when he is not on parade before society, but with his
family, with his children, with his servants; listen to his
casual remarks; observe his character as it transpires at all the
thousand pores of daily life; and the impression will be in the
main true; it will correspond to what he really is.</p>
<p>It would be a very curious, and I doubt not a very alarming
spectacle, if we could all of us see how very much we have done
in the course of our lives by unconscious influence.&nbsp; But
this is what history and biography never reveal.&nbsp; They tell
us of enterprises taken in hand, battles fought, good causes
advocated and won, in short, of every stir and movement made in
the world.&nbsp; But of that subtle reciprocal leavening of human
characters by one another of which we are speaking, because it is
so noiselessly effected, they take no account.&nbsp; Yet secret
and silent as it is, this involuntary influence is infinitely
more powerful than the voluntary.&nbsp; Just so some of the most
powerful agents in Nature are the quietest&mdash;do <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>not thunder
upon the ear or flash upon the eye.&nbsp; Gravitation is a
tremendous force, operating all around us, and binding the
planets to the Sun.&nbsp; Yet Gravitation is perfectly noiseless.
<a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a></p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>You
would consider, I suppose, that the ends of an Institution like
this were fully answered, and <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>then only <i>fully</i> answered, if
the shadow of St. Peter&rsquo;s Home were, in the high sense of
the word, a <i>healing</i> shadow&mdash;if the moral and
spiritual influence exercised by the Sisters upon the patients
were such that souls were won by it to Our Lord.&nbsp; And I can
quite conceive that this might be so under the proper
conditions.&nbsp; True; the period for which each patient may
reside in the Home is but short.&nbsp; But then three or four
weeks&rsquo; association with devoted servants of Christ, whose
devotion transpires naturally and is not obtrusively put forward,
may, under His Grace, work a great change, and leave an
impression which will never be erased.&nbsp; Even the shadow of
Peter passing by is sometimes effectual to a spiritual
cure.&nbsp; If the fire of God&rsquo;s Grace is burning bright
and clear upon the altar of our hearts, it will throw out sparks
in our passage through life.&nbsp; And it is in the nature of
sparks to kindle, when they light on combustible material.&nbsp;
Every soul with which we come in contact is sympathetic, and
accessible at all times through its sensibilities.&nbsp; And its
sympathies and sensibilities become greater oftentimes in the
hour of weakness and necessary withdrawal from the world.&nbsp;
Persons come to your Home to convalesce.&nbsp; They are not in
bodily pain; for their cure is supposed to be already effected in
the Hospital.&nbsp; Their hearts are in some measure predisposed
to gratitude by a sense of God&rsquo;s goodness in restoring
them, and of your kindness in receiving them under your
roof.&nbsp; <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Hence you have a very fair field for the exertion of
Christian influence.&nbsp; And I can well conceive that many
might derive a lasting benefit from association with you; and
that looking back upon their past lives in advanced age they
might say: &ldquo;The first impressions I had of the reality of
things unseen, and of the powers of the world to come, was given
me at St. Peter&rsquo;s Home, not so much by any definite
teaching I carried away, as by the whole conduct and way of life
of the Sisters.&nbsp; In tending me, they made me feel that their
ways and aims were not of this world; and I still retain the
impression which that sight of living goodness made upon
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be so, my Sisters in Christ, if while you diligently
tend these patients in pursuance of the vocation which you have
undertaken, you at the same time diligently cultivate the
interior life of piety in your own hearts.&nbsp; And in order to
that diligent cultivation, I shall prescribe to you to-day three
spiritual exercises, comprehending, as I believe, the sum and
substance of Personal Religion.&nbsp; I believe that the diligent
practice of all three will enable any one, by God&rsquo;s good
blessing, to cast a healing shadow, to throw all around him a
decided influence for good; and that even one of them devoutly
observed, and wrought into the texture of the mind, will be the
means of great advance.&nbsp; But though I speak of them in these
terms, and promise these effects from them, you must not suppose
that <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>I am
going to give other than the plainest and most commonplace
advice.&nbsp; I have no specific for the conduct of a spiritual
life but such as has been given you over and over again; and if I
had, you would rightly regard it with suspicion.&nbsp; For the
way of Christ&rsquo;s Saints, blessed be His Name, is a
well-trodden way; and the advice for His Church, when she would
seek Him, is, &ldquo;Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the
flock.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; The first practice we recommend for securing a holy
influence upon others is the Practice of God&rsquo;s
Presence,&mdash;that the mind should be momentarily collected in
hours of business, as well as in hours of devotion&mdash;the
oftener the better&mdash;and placed with a holy ejaculation, or a
devout aspiration, or an expression of confidence or love, under
His Eye.&nbsp; I should not know how better to define this
exercise than by calling it a momentary glance at Christ, away
even from those occupations which are the task-work He has set
us.&nbsp; A momentary glance.&nbsp; Do not think it necessary
always mentally to repeat some set ejaculation; that might be a
distraction, and create absence of mind, when all your faculties
are needed for what you are engaged in; but look away to Him for
the instant, and then back again, nothing doubting but that He
can interpret for you the need of your heart.</p>
<p>The importance of this practice in the cultivation <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>of the
spiritual life can really be hardly exaggerated.&nbsp; To begin
with the beginning.&nbsp; We read that the first effect of the
Fall upon the mind of our first parents was to make them shun
God, and hide themselves from the Divine Presence among the trees
of the garden.&nbsp; Now Grace is corrective of the mischief done
by the Fall; and its operations are the very reverse of those of
our corrupt nature.&nbsp; As sin therefore drives man to screen
himself by diversions, or by business, from God&rsquo;s Presence,
so it is one of the first instincts of Grace to seek God&rsquo;s
Face.&nbsp; We may do so now with the utmost confidence through
the Blood of Our Lord, knowing that Justice itself has nothing to
allege against us when we come before God with that plea; and the
oftener we do so amidst the occupations, hurry, and cares of
daily life, the holier and the happier shall we be.&mdash;Next;
this is the only real method of fulfilling the great New
Testament Prayer-precept; &ldquo;Pray without
ceasing.&rdquo;&nbsp; We must not fritter away the meaning of
those sacred words, by representing them to our minds as a
rhetorical form of saying, &ldquo;<i>Pray very
often</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; To pray is to seek God&rsquo;s
Face&mdash;is it not?&nbsp; Then if a state of mind could be more
or less realized, in which the soul is always conscious of being
under God&rsquo;s Eye, would not that be prayer without
ceasing?&nbsp; And this state is not to be attained except by
constant momentary reminiscences of God&rsquo;s neighbourhood,
and fervent breathings of the heart <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>towards Him.&nbsp; When attained, it
does not really interfere with occupations, though it might seem
that in any mental work it would be a distraction to turn the
mind away.&nbsp; For the state is a consciousness of God&rsquo;s
Presence.&nbsp; Now consciousness of the human presence is quite
compatible with vigorous exercise of the mind.&nbsp; I am
thinking at present of the subject on which I am speaking to you,
and how I am to prosecute it; yet not for a moment do I lose the
consciousness that your eye is upon me.&nbsp; Again; say that I
am walking to a certain place, and that in doing so, I am engaged
in earnest conversation with a friend.&nbsp; We are both thinking
of our arguments, and how we shall meet what is advanced by one
another; but all the while, the consciousness is present to us
that we are making the right turns, and really advancing to the
place for which we are bound.&nbsp; But I should wrong the sense
of the Divine Presence, if I said only that it need be no
interference with our occupations; I should rather say that it is
the greatest furtherance to them.&nbsp; For every work needs
energy to be done well; and what secret of energy is comparable
to the refreshment of spirit which may be derived from the
thought that we are under God&rsquo;s Eye, working for Him, and
with the encouragement of His smile?&nbsp; The thought is as like
a breath of sweet air sweeping across a wayside dusty
heather.&mdash;Once again; Faith is the great principle of the
renewal of our character.&nbsp; <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Without Faith there is no elevation
of mind, no spiritual buoyancy, no hope, no possibility of
advance or improvement.&nbsp; Now when we recommend the constant
reminiscence of God, we recommend virtually a constant exercise
of Faith.&nbsp; &ldquo;Faith is the evidence of things not
seen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Presence of God is of course a
&ldquo;thing not seen.&rdquo;&nbsp; And of all things not seen it
is the nearest to us, and that in which we have the most vital
interest.&nbsp; Habitually to assure our hearts of this
&ldquo;thing not seen&rdquo; is to live by Faith.&nbsp; And to
live by Faith is to overcome the world and self; it is the life
for which Christ redeemed, and for which the Holy Ghost
regenerated us.</p>
<p>Most true it is that those who honestly attempt this exercise
of Faith find it difficult.&nbsp; What attainment worth making,
either in things natural or spiritual, was ever easy?&nbsp; Every
thing is granted, not instantaneously, but in course of time, to
prayer and striving.&nbsp; &ldquo;Try again&rdquo; is the simple
expedient, which must be resorted to after a hundred
failures.&nbsp; No wonder that in a world of sense and numberless
distractions the Presence of God should be a hard lesson to
learn.&nbsp; But when learned, it is a great secret of holy
influence; for it transpires, though we say nothing to that
effect, through the calmness and brightness of our minds, that we
are much with God.&nbsp; And a portion of this lesson may be
mastered daily.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>II.&nbsp; The second practice recommended for the
cultivation of the interior life is that of submission to the
Will of God.&nbsp; This submission we may and must learn to yield
in the little trials and crosses of daily life.&nbsp; The real
reason why, when great trials come, Christians are so little
prepared to meet them&mdash;why even persons religious in the
main are all abroad, and know not which way to turn, when they
are visited with bereavement or bodily suffering&mdash;is, that
they have never, if I may so say, acclimatized themselves to the
loving endurance of God&rsquo;s Will amidst the numerous little
thwartings and contradictions of daily life.&nbsp; People
<i>will</i> go on thinking (or acting as if they thought) that
nothing short of a calamity is a sufficiently dignified occasion
for the display of religious principle; and thus they do not
avail themselves of the annoyances of daily life, as a field for
the cultivation of patience and surrender of the will.&nbsp; And
thus numerous precious opportunities of growth in grace run to
waste.</p>
<p>My Sisters in Christ, cultivate this habit of surrendering
your will in trifling matters to God.&nbsp; You must know by
experience that the discipline of an Institution like this is by
no means a security against the little crosses and contradictions
of daily life.&nbsp; A task falls to your lot which is not that
which you like best, or think yourself most fit for.&nbsp; Or, a
patient is discontented and hard to <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>please, peevish in the course of
convalescence, and apparently unmindful of the kindness you are
showing her.&nbsp; Or, there is some collision of tempers between
Sisters of very different characters.&nbsp; Or, there is some
cause of anxiety connected with your absent family, which weighs
heavily upon your mind, and tempts you to collapse into a
mechanical performance of your duties.&nbsp; Now these and the
like circumstances may all be accepted devoutly as the little
cross&mdash;the cross exactly fitted to your stature and
strength&mdash;which your Divine Master bids you take up and
carry after Him.&nbsp; Pray and try to embrace it as His choice
for you.&nbsp; Say in your heart, when the stress of the trial is
painfully felt, &ldquo;This is the Will of God in Christ Jesus
concerning me;&rdquo; and give God thanks for it, as for all the
incidents of your lot.&nbsp; Not the Will of God simply, but the
Will of God <i>in Christ Jesus</i> concerning me; a Will
therefore of infinite Love and Grace, reaching me as it does
through the avenue of my Saviour&rsquo;s Mediation.&nbsp;
Practise this with prayer continually; and the gradual result
will be a growing suavity and equableness of spirit, which cannot
be disturbed even by great reverses.&nbsp; And there is no part
of the Christian Example which tells more upon others than this
suavity and equableness.&nbsp; A mind which (though all its
susceptibilities are alive) cannot be thrown into disorder or
robbed of its serenity by troubles, makes itself felt by all who
come within the range <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>of its influence as a heavenly
mind.&nbsp; It is St. Peter&rsquo;s shadow falling on a fever
patient.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>III.&nbsp; The third and last practice recommended to you is
that of a single intention, directing all you do, however secular
and commonplace, to the Service of Christ in His members.&nbsp;
In a place like this you have great advantages for this
exercise.&nbsp; In ordinary life the pursuits of men and women
(with the exception of the Pastoral Charge) can only be connected
<i>remotely</i> with the great end of Our Lord&rsquo;s
Service.&nbsp; It is His will, no doubt, that the present system
of Society should work on till the Second Advent; and its
continuance involves all the various duties which flow out of
various positions.&nbsp; I am well aware that the humblest of
these duties may have the right intention imported into it, and
become through that intention an acceptable service; but still it
is an advantage to have a duty which stands in very near relation
to the great end.&nbsp; Now your duties here are of this
character.&nbsp; You tend the infirm, or you instruct the
ignorant, or you visit the poor.&nbsp; Now it is very easy to see
in each sick person, in each ignorant person, in each poor
person, a member of Christ.&nbsp; He Himself has constituted the
hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick, the
prisoner, His representatives, and has assured us that what is
done to them, He will count as done to Himself.&nbsp; So that
these patients, <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>these pupils, these destitute people, are in fact a
Sacrament, having Christ hidden underneath them.&nbsp; They
indicate to us where He is, and in what quarter we may do Him
direct Service.&nbsp; Now this should be to you, not a great
comfort only, but a great help in the Divine Life.&nbsp; The
intention to serve Him in His members may be so readily formed,
no doubt whatever resting on the fact that He may be really
served in this shape.&nbsp; Then, too, this thought will stand
you in good stead, when your kindness is not reciprocated; when
you are met by indifference and coldness, or thrown out of heart
by ignorance and perversity.&nbsp; It was not to them you offered
your service, but to Him in them.&nbsp; And you may be sure that,
whatever their mind may be, He is not unrighteous to forget your
work and labour of love, which love ye have showed for His
Name&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; You may have failed in your object of
giving relief, or communicating instruction, or soothing a
sufferer; but there can be no failure in the Service rendered to
Him, if your intention to render it has been sincere.&nbsp;
Remember in this matter of intention that there is no duty so
trifling, no service so humble, which may not be done to the
Lord.&nbsp; And in doing the commonest things, pray and strive to
exclude as much as may be the operation of lower motives.&nbsp;
Let the thought be simply, &ldquo;For Thee, dear
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the habit has been acquired of doing
trifles thus, it <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>will communicate a grace to our actions, and a
brightness and alacrity to our spirits in performing them, which
cannot fail of being felt by those under whose eyes we act.&nbsp;
Men and women are very quick at reading one another&rsquo;s real
motives.&nbsp; Worldliness of heart and secularity of aim is sure
to transpire to those around us, however much we may array
ourselves in the livery of religion.&nbsp; Love of power, or love
of pre-eminence, or mortified vanity,&mdash;if we are under the
dominion of these sentiments, we cannot easily disguise them from
others, however effectually we may close our own eyes to their
presence within.&nbsp; And similarly, when the simple motive to
serve and please Christ reigns in any heart, men speedily
discover it, and recognize it as something above nature.&nbsp;
And the discovery of this supernatural aim impresses them much
more forcibly for good than a thousand efforts made of set
purpose to reclaim and convert them.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We have spoken of the Service rendered to Christ in His
members.&nbsp; Fervently do I trust that in all English
Sisterhoods this Service will ever hold a foremost place.&nbsp;
We tremble for these Institutions as sure rapidly to deteriorate,
whenever the notion insinuates itself that there is any life
higher than that of active beneficence fed from the springs of
devotion.&nbsp; My Sisters in Christ, if such a thought ever
creeps into your heart, let <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>me pray you instantly to reject it,
as totally contrary to the Word of God and to the Mind of Christ,
however specious in appearance.&nbsp; It is indeed wonderful how,
to any person who has the Holy Scriptures in his hand, the notion
of a life of exclusive contemplation and devotional exercise can
ever approve itself.&nbsp; The instances usually quoted in favour
of such a life, St. John the Baptist and Elijah the Prophet, are
singularly out of point.&nbsp; For while it is of course true
that these men did not live the ordinary domestic life of their
times, that for the great purpose of their miraculous vocation
they withdrew from home and family ties, it is notoriously untrue
that they came into no contact with their fellow-men.&nbsp; They
were national reformers; and national reformers cannot do their
work without coming into rude collision with the sins, and
prejudices, and errors of their day; when they were taken from
the earth, it was with all the soil and dust of Earth&rsquo;s
conflict upon them.&nbsp; Thus these eminent characters lend not
a particle of support to the idea that a life of entire isolation
from our fellow-creatures is legitimate or after the Scriptural
model.&nbsp; Nor does the idea gain any real countenance from the
example of St. John the Apostle.&nbsp; True it is that he was not
conspicuous for activity, like his great colleagues, St. Peter
and St. Paul; that his character had in it probably a larger
share of reflection than of will; but, whether we look at the
fact of his <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>having composed under Inspiration the profoundest part
of the Canon of the New Testament, and having presided over the
Seven Churches of Asia, or at the traditions of his bringing the
robber chieftain, who had been one of his flock, to repentance,
and of his Sermons in old age reducing themselves to the one
precept, &ldquo;Little children, love one another,&rdquo; it is
clear that, however contemplative the bent of his mind, he did a
work of vast importance for his fellow-men.&nbsp; Indeed he is
the great human model of the grace of Charity.&nbsp; And I may
remind you that the inspired description of this grace (the
highest of all the Evangelical Virtues) sets it forth almost
exclusively in its aspect <i>towards man</i>.&nbsp; Charity is
the sweetest flower which grows in the garden of the soul.&nbsp;
And in what spots does this flower flourish?&nbsp; St.
Paul&rsquo;s panegyric of Charity plainly shows that its place is
in the world, where are oppositions, collisions, provocations,
suspicions; &ldquo;Charity <i>suffereth long</i>, and is kind;
doth not behave itself unseemly, <i>seeketh not her own</i>,
<i>is not easily provoked</i>, thinketh no evil; <i>beareth all
things</i>, believeth all things, hopeth all things, <i>endureth
all things</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the most conclusive of all arguments against a life
exclusively contemplative in a world of sin and sorrow is the
pattern of Our Blessed Lord Himself.&nbsp; One would have thought
that at least His Example might have saved His followers from <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>this
miserable delusion.&nbsp; If His contact with Society was the
closest; if He went about doing good; if His active works of
mercy did not cease even at the moment of His apprehension; if
the Cross itself could not silence His tongue from words of
consolation, nor make Him unmindful of the sorrows of others; how
shall any one profess to follow Him, who on principle ignores the
claim which the sins and sufferings of men have upon Him; how
shall any one presume to think that he has found a higher walk of
the spiritual life than that in which Our Lord Himself
walked?&nbsp; My Sisters in Christ, it is because this yearning
after a complete withdrawal from the active works of mercy, this
false ideal of a life holier than Christ&rsquo;s life, has
unhappily shown itself in some of the English Sisterhoods, that
being here by the invitation of your Superior, I speak thus
strongly and plainly on the subject.&nbsp; Be well assured that
any life, the plan of which is out of conformity with the Word of
God and the Example of Christ, will be attended with the worst
results upon the character of her who adopts or seeks to adopt
it.&nbsp; The mind recoils (and that not at all in virtue of its
sinfulness) from mere contemplation.&nbsp; It was made by God for
action, and for the reciprocation of sympathy; and mischief is
sure to ensue from any attempt to alter the laws of its
constitution.&nbsp; Without healthy exercise in Acts of Mercy it
must grow morbid, <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>narrow, superstitious, fanatical.&nbsp; I know that your
rule in this Institution is to devote yourselves to works of
Benevolence; still it cannot be out of place to warn you against
dangers, which beset similar Communities with your own; and I
find a trace of your Founder&rsquo;s jealousy of your diversion
from these works in the ninth of your Primary Statutes: &ldquo;No
Sister shall be required to spend more time in her private
devotions than her own conscience shall lead her to desire; nor
shall she spend any time for this purpose to the hindrance (in
the opinion of the Superior) of the active work of mercy to which
she shall be dedicated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who framed this wise
rule must have been aware of the morbid tendency in Communities
like these to withdraw from the field of Active Benevolence,
under the plea of more entire dedication to God.</p>
<p>Presuming therefore that your work in this place, like all
active work, will be beset by many of the distractions and
hindrances of ordinary life, I have given rules for the
cultivation of spirituality amidst common engagements, which
under God&rsquo;s Blessing may serve to keep the heart true to
the Lord, while there is much work upon the hands.&nbsp; In
conclusion I will recapitulate these rules;</p>
<p class="poetry">Practise the Presence of God.<br />
Practise submission to His Will in little Crosses.<br />
Practise the doing all things for Christ.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Thus
the Patients, whom you shelter and tend, shall feel a calming,
sanctifying influence from their temporary association with you;
and shall look back with grateful reminiscences to the period
when, before their return to the heat and dust and turmoil of
Life, and to the glare of Life&rsquo;s temptations, they were
gathered in under the quiet shadow of St. Peter&rsquo;s Home.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES.</h2>
<p><a name="footnote14"></a><a href="#citation14"
class="footnote">[14]</a>&nbsp; This illustration, as well as all
the thoughts of the paragraph containing it, is borrowed from the
noble Sermon of Dr. Bushnell on &ldquo;Unconscious
Influence.&rdquo;&nbsp; I give his words <i>in extenso</i>; for I
believe few grander passages can be found anywhere: &ldquo;But
you must not conclude that influences of this kind are
insignificant because they are unnoticed and noiseless.&nbsp; How
is it in the natural world?&nbsp; Behind the mere show, the
outward noise, and stir of the world, nature always conceals her
hand of control, and the laws by which she rules.&nbsp; Who ever
saw with the eye, for example, or heard with the ear, the
exertions of that tremendous astronomic force, which every moment
holds the compact of the physical universe together?&nbsp; The
lightning is, in fact, but a mere fire-fly spark in comparison;
but because it glares on the clouds, and thunders so terribly in
the air, and rives the tree or rock where it falls, many will be
ready to think that it is a vastly more potent agent than
gravity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bible calls the good man&rsquo;s life a light, and
it is the nature of light to flow out spontaneously in all
directions, and fill the world unconsciously with its
beams.&nbsp; So the Christian shines, it would say, not so much
because he will, as because he is a luminous object&mdash;not
that the active influence of Christians is made of no account in
the figure, but only that this symbol of light has its propriety
in the fact, that their unconscious influence is the chief
influence, and has the precedence in its power over the
world&mdash;and yet, there are many who will be ready to think
that light is a very tame and feeble instrument, because it is
noiseless.&nbsp; An earthquake, for example, is to them a much
more vigorous and effective agency.&nbsp; Hear how it comes
thundering through the solid foundations of nature!&nbsp; It
rocks a whole continent.&nbsp; The noblest works of man, cities,
monuments, and temples, are in a moment levelled to the ground,
or swallowed down the opening gulfs of fire.&nbsp; Little do they
think that the light of every morning, the soft, genial, and
silent light, is an agent many times more powerful.&nbsp; But let
the light of the morning cease and return no more, let the hour
of morning come, and bring with it no dawn; the outcries of a
horror-stricken world fill the air, and make, as it were, the
darkness audible.&nbsp; The beasts go wild and frantic at the
loss of the sun.&nbsp; The vegetable growths turn pale and
die.&nbsp; A chill creeps on, and frosty winds begin to howl
across the freezing earth.&nbsp; Colder, and yet colder is the
night.&nbsp; The vital blood at length, of all creatures stops
congealed.&nbsp; Down goes the frost toward the earth&rsquo;s
centre.&nbsp; The heart of the sea is frozen; nay, the
earthquakes are themselves frozen in under their fiery
caverns.&nbsp; The very globe itself, too, and all the
fellow-planets that have lost their sun, are to become mere balls
of ice, swinging silent in the darkness.&nbsp; Such is the light,
which revisits us in the silence of the morning.&nbsp; It makes
no shock or scar.&nbsp; It would not wake an infant in his
cradle, and yet it perpetually new creates the world, rescuing it
each morning as a prey from night and chaos.&nbsp; So the
Christian is a light, even &lsquo;the light of the world;&rsquo;
and we must not think that because he shines insensibly or
silently, as a mere luminous object, he is therefore
powerless.&nbsp; The greatest powers are ever those which lie
back of the little stirs and commotions of nature; and I verily
believe that the insensible influences of good men are as much
more potent than what I have called their voluntary or active, as
the great silent powers of nature are of greater consequence than
her little disturbances and &lsquo;tumults.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been told that Dr. Bushnell&rsquo;s Theology is unsound
on the fundamental doctrine of the Trinity.&nbsp; I have not seen
any thing to prove this charge in &ldquo;The New Life&rdquo; (the
only volume I have ever seen of his); but, while I cannot borrow
his thoughts without an acknowledgment, I am bound to mention the
allegation as a caution to those who fall in with his
works.&nbsp; &ldquo;The New Life&rdquo; is full of noble
sentiments, most eloquently enforced; and there is great danger
now-a-days lest sentiments of this sort should be accepted as
compounding for want of definite dogma&mdash;the only foundation
of all true Religion.&nbsp; A Religion of sentiment only, not
holding of a Creed, would resemble a body of flesh and blood,
without a substructure of solid bones.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
